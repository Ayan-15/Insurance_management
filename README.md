# Insurance_management
This project involves the development of a smart contract-based insurance system on the Ethereum blockchain. This decentralized application will automate the management of insurance policies, including policy issuance, premium payments, claim submissions, and payouts. Leveraging blockchain technology, the system will enhance transparency, reduce administrative overhead, and ensure that all transactions are secure and immutable. Smart contracts will automate key processes, reducing the risk of human error and fraud, and ensuring that claims are processed swiftly and accurately
